# Food recipe django

The Online Food Recipe Management System is a web-based application developed using Django (Python framework) and SQLite as the backend database. This system is designed to allow users to browse, share, and manage food recipes efficiently.
The platform enables users to create accounts, log in securely, and explore a wide variety of recipes. Users can also contribute their own recipes by filling out a form with ingredients, cooking instructions, images, and other relevant details. Recipes are categorized to make browsing easier (e.g., vegetarian, desserts, quick meals, etc.).
An admin panel is available for managing user activities, approving submitted recipes, and maintaining the integrity of the platform content. This project includes core features such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), user authentication, and responsive design.
